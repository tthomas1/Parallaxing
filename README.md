Parallaxing
===========

Got curious in what it would take to implement parallax scrolling in a website. Put together this little project using the [Parallax.JS](http://pixelcog.com/parallax.js/) library.

Will remain as a reference when I need to remember how to add parallax, not intended to be finished.
